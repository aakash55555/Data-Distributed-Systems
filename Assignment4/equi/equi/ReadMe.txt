Mapper--> Map will process the input data and will give the output as an intermediate key value pair which will be used by the reducer. It will take one line at a time from the record reader which will read one line at a time and mapper will process it. 

Reducer--> Reducer will use the intermediate key value pair generated by the mapper and perform the shuffling and sorting in the input produced to give the final output.

Driver--> This is the main function from which Map and Reduce methods will be called. It will set all the configuration like name of mapper class file, name of reducer class file, input file path and output file path.
